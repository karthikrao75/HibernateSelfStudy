@Inheritatace is not mandatory
if @Inheritance is not used it will use single table strategy to create a table  

Hibernate: insert into Vehicle (vehiclename, DTYPE, vehicleId) values (?, 'Vehicle', ?)
Hibernate: insert into Vehicle (vehiclename, steeringhandle, DTYPE, vehicleId) values (?, ?, 'TwoWheeler', ?)
Hibernate: insert into Vehicle (vehiclename, steeringWheel, DTYPE, vehicleId) values (?, ?, 'FourWheeler', ?)

where DTYPE is a discriminator Type which helps in identifying the type of object or class that the row contains

@Inheritance(strategy=InheritanceType.SINGLE_TABLE)
here strategy tells how the table has to be created , InheritanceType is an enumeration used  to get type of 
inheritance table .

@DiscriminatorColumn(name="VEHICLE_TYPE",
discriminatorType=DiscriminatorType.STRING)
//by default discriminator type will be string
 this tag is used in parent class 
 name attribute will change the column name from DTYPE to user specified Name 
 discriminatorType will tell which type of value it must store -Integer,Char or String.
 
 DTYPE of child class will have default value as class name
 in case we want to change the value then use
 @DiscriminatorValue(value="TWO_VEHICLE")
 
 so finally table will be
 
 Hibernate: insert into Vehicle (vehiclename, VEHICLE_TYPE, vehicleId) values (?, 'Vehicle', ?)
Hibernate: insert into Vehicle (vehiclename, steeringhandle, VEHICLE_TYPE, vehicleId) values (?, ?, 'TWO_VEHICLE', ?)
Hibernate: insert into Vehicle (vehiclename, steeringWheel, VEHICLE_TYPE, vehicleId) values (?, ?, 'FOUR_VEHICLE', ?)
